# Alarm-System
PIR motion sensor is used
- Passcode: 1234, by default
- When system is activated, the green LED turns on and the program starts reading signal from the connected PIR motion sensor. If any motion has been detected, the program turns of the green LED and sends “Detected motion!” message to the LCD screen and starts generating an alarm tone on buzzer along with red LED turned on until the motion finishes. When no motion is detected, only the system’s state “Locked” is displayed on the LCD and green LED is on. User can deactivate (unlock) a security system by providing the same passcode as for activation of the system using keypad. If the system is not active the system’s state “Not locked” is displayed on LCD.
